# Playground-june

I decided to start this competition on 2022-06-08.

The dataset is about [Tabular Playground Series - Jun 2022](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tabular-playground-series-jun-2022/overview) (see the link for an overview of the dataset).

## Competition goal

_For this challenge, you are given (simulated) manufacturing control data that contains missing values due to electronic errors. Your task is to predict the values of all missing data in this dataset. (Note, while there are continuous and categorical features, only the continuous features have missing values.)_
